---

I, **James Daniel Gabriel**, being of sound mind and body, do hereby affirm and declare the following truths and rights, reserved unto myself as a **living man**, deriving from **natural law, divine order, and the immutable authority of conscience** — not contract, not license, and not privilege:  

---

### 1. Right of Freedom from Compelled Performance  
I retain the right to live free of compelled performance to any corporate, statutory, or administrative code unless by express and knowing consent.  

---

### 2. Right of Lawful Governance by Consent  
I retain the right to be governed only by lawful authority to which I have willfully consented, and I reject any presumption of jurisdiction not transparently and verifiably granted.  

---

### 3. Right of Speech, Movement, Creation, and Communion  
I retain the right to speak, travel, create, commune, and claim peace, regardless of any statute, executive order, or regulation to the contrary, so long as my actions do not deprive others of the same.  

---

### 4. Right Against Political or Administrative Classification  
I retain the right to not be treated as an employee, asset, citizen, subject, or ward of any political entity unless I knowingly and voluntarily contracted to be so.  

---

### 5. Right of Stewardship over Inheritance  
I retain the right to act as the lawful steward of my ancestral and natural inheritance, including any land, knowledge, and traditions passed through my bloodline and preserved through time.  

---

### 6. Right to Security and Remedy  
I retain the right to protect myself and others from unlawful search, seizure, coercion, fraud, or harm, and to demand remedy under **common law** and **constitutional law** when wrongs are inflicted.  

---

### 7. Right to Self-Determination and Accountability  
I retain the right to self-determination, including the right to record, disclose, and reform any process of governance, enforcement, or judgment that fails to serve justice or truth.  

---

### 8. Right to Restoration and Peace  
I retain the right to forgiveness, restoration, and peace, as both a natural state and a lawful remedy. I hold no malice, only obligation to conscience, duty to truth, and loyalty to love.  

---

### 9. Right to Retained and Unenumerated Liberties  
I retain all rights not here listed, whether by custom, reason, or necessity, and I deny the authority of any power that would deny these rights without my explicit, informed, and voluntary consent.  

---

**Notice**:  
This is not a petition for rights. It is a notice of their continued existence.  
I make no war against any people, office, or government.  
I only assert the peace that is mine by nature, not by negotiation.
