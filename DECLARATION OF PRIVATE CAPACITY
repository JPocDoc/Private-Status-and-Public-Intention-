# Affidavit of Private Capacity and Declaration of Intent  
**Affidavit of James Daniel Gabriel**  
**Private Individual and Non-Statutory Status Declaration**

---

**I, James Daniel Gabriel**, of lawful age and sound mind, hereby affirm, declare, and make this solemn affidavit to establish and record my **status as a private individual** and my **intent to operate in a private capacity**, not under statutory jurisdiction except by my voluntary, explicit, and knowing consent.

---

### 1. Declaration of Status and Intent

I am a **living, natural man**, an expression and embodiment in the likeness of my Creator, existing lawfully in full capacity, unrestricted by compromise or compelled consent. I rebut all presumptions of jurisdiction absent proof of claim.  

I exercise my natural rights, as secured under the **Bill of Rights** and the **Constitution of the United States of America**, including but not limited to:  
- **First Amendment** (speech, association, conscience, petition),  
- **Fourth Amendment** (security of person, property, papers, effects),  
- **Fifth Amendment** (due process, protection against self-incrimination), and  
- **Fourteenth Amendment** (due process and equal protection).  

I declare that I do not consent to being treated as a “person” as that term is defined under federal or state statutes, nor do I recognize any assumption that I am subject to statutory jurisdiction absent explicit and voluntary agreement.

### 2. Private Capacity Affirmation

I affirm my standing in **private capacity**, outside of any presumed **public office** or governmental persona.  

I am not engaged in commerce or activities requiring registration under the **laws of the United States (U.S. Const. art. I, §8)** or the **laws of Georgia**, absent my written consent. My rights are exercised under **Natural Law** and **Common Law**, not subject to statutory enforcement unless I have knowingly entered into such jurisdiction by contract.  

I expressly reserve the right to protect my person, property, and agreements from any infringement by government or corporate bodies lacking lawful jurisdiction.  

---

### 3. Notice of Non-Consent to Statutory Enforcement

I do not consent to being compelled or presumed to act as a **taxpayer**, **employee**, or **subject** under any statutory definition, unless I have explicitly and voluntarily accepted such status by contract.  

I hereby give notice that I do not consent to forced registration, taxation, or regulation where no valid contract exists.  

---

### 4. Reservation of Rights

I reserve all rights under the **Constitution of the United States** and the **Constitution of the State of Georgia**, including but not limited to liberty, privacy, property, and due process.  

I have made no contractual agreement that waives or diminishes these rights. All rights are expressly reserved under **U.C.C. § 1-308** (reservation of rights) and **U.C.C. § 1-103** (common law rights preserved).
